## Vision Statement
<b>Problem Statement</b>
<br>
For college students and anyone associated with them, Rate My Dorm Setup is an easy-to-use website to inspire and share ideas and layouts to maximize a dorm room. Unlike similar social media sites such as facebook and twitter, Rate My Dorm Setup is solely focused on rooms and dorms meaning that there are no sidetracks and difficulties finding what you like. Problems such as how do I make my room look better or which building on campus has the best dorm rooms can be solved with Rate My Dorm Setup. If someone wants to improve their room they can get ideas from it, and if someone wants to figure out what is the best residential building on campus, they can use Rate My Dorm to see the rooms and make a decision.
